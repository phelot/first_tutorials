"Do your commits and pushes often"

Pulls
If we're working with changes, we can work inside of a branch.
This way we don't trounce upon our stable master.
When we finish up with a branch and want to push it back to the master we Pull.
A Pull is a request to merge the branch with the master.
At a later point, an administrator will approve the merge.
Once merged a branch can be deleted.
