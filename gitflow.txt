Getting Used to and Understanding Git and GitHub

git clone <url>
git add
commit
push

"Do your commits and pushes often"

=Branches

=Forks
So what happens with OpenSource Projects?
We create a personal copy of the project and then we can offer those changes back later
It's a full fledged repository of the master and it's many branches
We can create a new branch

$git branch <feature-branch>
$git checkout <feature-branch>
Switched to branch '<feature-branch>'

then we do our git add, git commit -m
then we do an opt in
git push -u origin <feature-branch> 

=Pull Requests
If we're working with changes, we can work inside of a branch.
This way we don't trounce upon our stable master.
When we finish up with a branch and want to push it back to the master we Pull.
A Pull is a request to merge the branch with the master.
At a later point, an administrator will review to approve or reject the merge.
Once merged a branch can be deleted.
